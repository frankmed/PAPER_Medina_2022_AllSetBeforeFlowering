## Abstract
Plant root microbiomes fulfil important functions in plant growth and health. Most bacterial members of these communities are recruited from the surrounding bulk soil. Although plants can shape their composition to some degree, as exemplified by differences between microbiota recruited by wild and domesticated genotypes of crops,  the locally available inoculum is an im-portant determinant, and knowledge on potential co-evolution. Here we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of rhizosphere and endosphere samples of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) plants growing in the open field within its centre of domestication. Total DNA extracted at the vegetative, flowering, and early pod filling stage yielded ## reads that were assigned to 17,352 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Rhizosphere communities were taxonomically richer than in the endosphere (## versus ##  OTUs) and mainly comprised of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidertes, Crenarchaeota and Proteobacteria, (endosphere: 99% Proteoacteria), while ontogenetic effects were less pronounced and mainly limited to   153 (out of 156) OTUs with different abundances between the vegetative and flowering stage. While in general, our results confirm common patterns, we also observed high abundances of phyla and genera that are not frequent-ly reported from bean Gemmatimonadetes (6%), Chloroflexi (4%) and the archaeal phylum Thaumarchaeota (Crenarcheaota, 11.5%), and genera being Candidatus Nitrososphaera (12%), Flavisolibacter (3%), Steroidobacter (3%). Moreover, the abundances of OTUs classified as Rhizobium (14) and Aeromonas (8) exhibited a 40-fold increase (from 3,000 reads to over 110,000) from the vegetative to the flowering stage (equivalent to 11% to 83% of reads assigned to the 156 differentially abundant OTUs or from 1.5% to over 6% of all reads), while the abundance of OTUs assigned to m) in the endosphere.
